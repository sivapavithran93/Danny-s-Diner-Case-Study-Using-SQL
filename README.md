# **Danny-s-Diner-Case-Study-Using-SQL**

# **8-Week SQL Challenges**

Danny’s Diner is a small Japanese restaurant that opened in early 2021, serving three fan-favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. While the restaurant quickly gained a modest following, Danny is now looking to leverage the data collected over the first few months of operation to better understand his customers.

The goal of this case study is to help Danny use SQL to derive actionable insights from his data, including customer spending patterns, visiting habits, and product preferences. These insights will enable Danny to personalize the dining experience for his loyal customers and make informed decisions on expanding the restaurant's customer loyalty program.

# **Key Objectives:**

- Customer Insights: How much do customers spend? How often do they visit?
- Menu Performance: Which items are most popular? What’s the first item each customer orders?
- Loyalty Program Impact: How do purchases change before and after joining the program?

# **Data Overview:**

The analysis is based on three core datasets:

- Sales: Captures customer purchases, including product IDs and order dates.
- Menu: Maps product IDs to menu items and prices.
- Members: Tracks when customers join the loyalty program.
